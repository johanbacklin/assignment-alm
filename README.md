# webb22_alm_cicd

### Group examination in Application Lifecycle Management

This is a project generated with Express using the EJS view engine template and enhanced with ESLint, Husky, and npm test with pre-commit hook. The project is a calculator API with two endpoints: /add/:param1&:param2 for addition and /sub/:param1&:param2 for subtraction.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the project:

* Node.js (version 18.16.0)

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

``git clone https://github.com/SofiaCoder/webb22_alm_cicd.git``

2. Navigate to the project directory:

``cd WEBB22_ALM_CICD``

3. Install the project dependencies:

``npm install``

4. Start the development server:

``npm start``

The server will be running at http://localhost:3000

## Endpoints

The following endpoints are available in the project:

* ``GET /add/:param1&:param2:`` Adds ``param1`` and ``param2`` and returns the result.
* ``GET /sub/:param1&:param2:`` Subtracts ``param2`` from ``param1`` and returns the result.

The ``param1`` and ``param2`` are placeholders for the actual numbers you want to calculate.

## Scripts

The following scripts are available in the project:

* ``start``: Starts the development server.
* ``eslint``: Runs ESLint to analyze and enforce code style.
* ``lint-fix``: Runs ESLint and attempts to automatically fix code style issues.
* ``test``: Runs the tests for the project.

## ESLint

_**ESLint**_ is a JavaScript linter that enforces code style and catches potential issues. It helps maintain consistent and high-quality code throughout the project. The ESLint configuration for this project can be found in the ``.eslintrc.yml`` file.

To run ESLint manually, use the following command:

``npm run eslint``

To automatically fix ESLint issues, use the following command:

``npm run lint-fix``

## Husky and npm test

_**Husky**_ is used to add Git hooks to the project. A pre-commit hook is configured to run ``npm test``, which executes the tests for the project before committing changes.
